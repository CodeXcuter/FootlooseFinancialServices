## How to Run Client facing web site

The client facing system requires SQL Server Express LocaleDB 2016 and IIS Express 10.0

- Download and install SqlLocalDB.msi from the download for [SQL Server Express LocalDB 2016] (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42299)
- Open the file FootlooseFS.Web.Service/web.config
	- Change the app setting "DataDirectory" to your specific location of the "FootlooseFinancialServices\Data" folder with the MDF file.
	
- Download and install [IIS 10.0 Express] (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48264)
- To start the WebAPI service open a command window and enter 
		"C:\Program Files\IIS Express\iisexpress" /path:C:\Users\Peter\Source\Repos\FootlooseFinancialServices\FootlooseFS.Web.Service /port:9095
	- Replace "C:\Users\Peter\Source\Repos" with your specific location of the Visual Studio project
- To start the AngularJS web site open a command window and enter
		"C:\Program Files\IIS Express\iisexpress" /path:C:\Users\Peter\Source\Repos\FootlooseFinancialServices\FootlooseFS.Web.Client /port:9092
	- Replace "C:\Users\Peter\Source\Repos" with your specific location of the Visual Studio project
- Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:9092
- Enter "avenere" for the user name and "avenere1" for the password" and click the Submit button.

The AngularJS web site uses the WebAPI web site for the data service. By default it communicates to the service on port 9095 but that can be modified
in the file C:\Users\Peter\Source\Repos\FootlooseFinancialServices\FootlooseFS.Web.Client\config.js
